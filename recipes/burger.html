    <p>Nothing says summer quite like a juicy grilled burger. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make these top-rated burger patties.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

    </ul>


    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>Whisk together egg, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs and mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
